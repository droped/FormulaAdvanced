# FormulaAdvanced (FormulaPro fork)

## Who .... ?
The two main developers are Jim Bauwens and Adrien Bertrand ("Adriweb") (and Pedro Diniz ("droped") in this repo).  
We also would like to thank Levak for his animation API and Nick Steen for the Resistor Reference part.
Many thanks too to Critor, Excale, NeoCrisis, alex3yoyo ... and TI of course :)

You could become part of this list by contributing too. ;-)

But if you don't wish to be involved in a big thing, you can help with issues, References and the Database (equations and stuff).

## What .... ?
